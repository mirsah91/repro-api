# Session Report\n\n
## 1. Executive Overview\nOn November 2, 2025, user **mir.test5@gmail.com** engaged with our application for a brief session lasting approximately 4 seconds. During this time, the user successfully created two new items labeled \"one\" and \"second\". The session was free of errors, and all actions completed successfully. However, the rapid succession of actions may indicate a need for performance monitoring to ensure that the system can handle multiple requests efficiently without impacting user experience.\n\n## 2. Detailed Technical Findings\n- **Session Duration**: 4 seconds (from 16:28:56 to 16:29:00)\n- **Actions Taken**:\n  1. **Click on \"Create One\"**: Triggered a request to create an item.\n     - **Timestamp**: 16:28:57\n     - **DB Change**: Inserted item with name \"one\" into the `items` collection.\n     - **DB Operation**: `insertOne`\n     - **Document Created**: \n       ```json\n       {\n         \"name\": \"one\",\n         \"status\": \"NEW\",\n         \"credits\": 0,\n         \"_id\": \"690786c90e7451b712441cc9\",\n         \"comments\": [],\n         \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:28:57.693Z\",\n         \"updatedAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:28:57.693Z\"\n       }\n       ```\n  2. **Click on \"Create Second\"**: Triggered another request to create a second item.\n     - **Timestamp**: 16:28:58\n     - **DB Change**: Inserted item with name \"second\" into the `items` collection.\n     - **DB Operation**: `insertOne`\n     - **Document Created**:\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"name\": \"second\",\n         \"status\": \"NEW\",\n         \"credits\": 0,\n         \"_id\": \"690786ca0e7451b712441ccb\",\n         \"comments\": [],\n         \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:28:58.139Z\",\n         \"updatedAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:28:58.139Z\"\n       }\n       ```\n\n- **Traces**: The application logs indicate that both item creations were processed without any exceptions or delays, confirming that the backend services are functioning as expected.\n\n## 3. Issues & Anomalies\n- **Errors**: No errors or failures were recorded during this session.\n- **Performance Metrics**: \n  - The time taken for the first item creation was approximately 0.4 seconds.\n  - The time taken for the second item creation was approximately 0.4 seconds.\n- **Slow Operations**: No slow operations were detected; however, the rapid succession of requests (within milliseconds) should be monitored to ensure the system can handle similar loads in the future.\n\n## 4. Recommended Next Steps\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to track the performance of item creation requests, especially during peak usage times.\n- **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to simulate multiple users creating items simultaneously to ensure the system can handle concurrent requests without degradation in performance.\n- **User Feedback**: Consider gathering user feedback on the item creation process to identify any potential areas for improvement.\n- **Documentation Update**: Ensure that the documentation for the item creation API is up-to-date, reflecting any recent changes or optimizations made to the backend services.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, we can enhance the user experience and maintain system reliability as user interactions increase.
